## My process

I started by going through and marking up my html/jsx from top to bottom before adding any functionality. Dividing out my sections of the page to prepare it for styling.
Afterwards I then go through adding css to get the page to look according to the design specifications, I started with a pc first approach, then mobile afterwards. I decided on this approach as thats how the designs were laid out to me but I am capable of doing bothways. 
Then I went through adding the functionality to some of the buttons such as the quantity of the item, and adding to the cart.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- React
- SCSS

### What I learned

I learned alot about react hooks, state management is a very easy way to create pop up menus such as a navigation, cart, or account info that needs to appear on screen without reloading the page.

### Continued development

I would like to focus on using typescript for my next project. Typescript is the future when creating projects as it will help you build a more manageable codebase.
